A relay is an electromechanical switch, which perform ON and OFF operations without any
human interaction.
A proximity sensor is a sensor in a position to detect the presence of nearby objects without any physical get in touch with. 
A proximity sensor often emits an electromagnetic field or a beam of electromagnetic radiation (infrared, for instance), 
and looks for changes in the field or return signal. The object becoming sensed is usually referred to as the proximity sensorâ€™s target.

/*
The program will act like a metal detector which produes buzzer sound,
whenever the proximity sensor detects metal through it Port-2, pin 0.
So whenever the proximity sensor senses an object nearby, the buzzer is enabled to
indicate this.
